=head1 NAME

Jedi::Response - response object

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the response you will have to fill from route to route.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 status

Status code, by default is 404 (not found).

You can consult the L<HTTP status|http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html> but here some common :

 500: internal server error
 404: route not found
 405: access forbidden
 204: no content
 200: status ok, with content
 302: redirect
 301: permanent redirect

=head2 headers

This contain the headers you will send with your response.

You should use the method L</set_header> and L</push_header> instead of filling this attribute directly.

The attribute has this form :

 key => [val1, val2 ...],
 key2 => [val4],

=head2 body

The body is the string return to the browser.

 $response->body("Hello World !");

=head1 METHODS

=head2 set_header

Set an header to a specific value.

 $response->set_header('X-AUTH', $token);
 $response->set_header('Location', 'http://blog.celogeek.com');

=head2 push_header

Push an header to a specific value

 $response->push_header('Set-Cookie', 'myCookie=a');
 $response->push_header('Set-Cookie', 'myCookie2=b');

You will see :

 Set-Cookie: myCookie=a
 Set-Cookie: myCookie=b

=head2 to_psgi

This return the content in a psgi form.

It is use by Jedi to transform the response into a valid psgi response.
